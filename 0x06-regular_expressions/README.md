**0x06. Regular expression**   
* Regex
* DevOps

This project is based on building regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that 
which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

Because the focus of this project is to familarize myself with regular expressions (regex).
